## 🧵 Kotlin Coroutines  

## 🔤 Definitions

- **Coroutine**: A lightweight thread-like construct used for asynchronous programming in Kotlin.
- **Lifecycle States**:
  - `NEW`: Coroutine is created but not started (`lazy` mode).
  - `ACTIVE`: Coroutine has started and is running.
  - `SUSPENDED`: Coroutine is paused temporarily (e.g., via `delay()`).
  - `CANCELLED`: Coroutine was stopped before completion.
  - `COMPLETED`: Coroutine finished its task successfully.

## 🧠 Mnemonics & Analogies (English + Urdu)

| State        | Mnemonic (English)                              | Analogy (Urdu)                                                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `NEW`        | "Newborn but asleep"                            | **Naya bacha paida hua hai, lekin abhi so raha hai** – coroutine abhi start nahi hui |
| `ACTIVE`     | "Engine started, wheels turning"                | **Gaari chal padi hai** – coroutine ka kaam shuru ho gaya hai 🔥              |
| `SUSPENDED`  | "Paused like a movie break"                     | **Movie pause kar di hai** – `delay()` ne temporary roka hai                  |
| `CANCELLED`  | "Emergency brake pulled"                        | **Brake maar di gayi** – kaam adhura chhod diya gaya                          |
| `COMPLETED`  | "Reached destination"                           | **Manzil mil gayi** – coroutine ne apna kaam mukammal kar liya 🏁              |

## 💻 Code Examples

### ✅ Basic Coroutine with Lifecycle Logging

```kotlin
// Importing all coroutine features
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // Creating a coroutine lazily (not started yet)
    val job = launch(start = CoroutineStart.LAZY) {
        println("🔥 Coroutine ACTIVE")
        delay(1000) // suspends coroutine for 1 second
        println("🏁 Coroutine COMPLETED")
    }

    println("State: NEW ➤ Coroutine created lazily (not started yet)")

    job.start() // starting the coroutine manually
    println("State: ACTIVE ➤ Coroutine started running")

    delay(500) // simulate mid-execution suspension
    println("State: SUSPENDED ➤ delay() temporarily paused coroutine")

    job.join() // wait until coroutine finishes execution
    println("State: COMPLETED ➤ Coroutine work finished successfully")
}
```

### ❌ Cancelling a Coroutine

```kotlin
// Import all coroutine utilities
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // Launch a coroutine in the current scope
    val job = launch {
        try {
            // Repeat 5 times with delay to simulate ongoing work
            repeat(5) { i ->
                println("Working... $i")
                delay(500) // suspends coroutine for 0.5 seconds
            }
        } 
        // This block catches cancellation
        catch (e: CancellationException) {
            println("State: CANCELLED ➤ Coroutine ko cancel kar diya gaya")
        } 
        // Always runs (like finally block in try-catch)
        finally {
            println("🏁 Coroutine COMPLETED ➤ Cleanup done")
        }
    }

    delay(1000) // Let the coroutine run for a while
    job.cancel() // Cancel the coroutine
    job.join() // Wait until coroutine fully terminates
}
```

## 🧭 `runBlocking` & `launch` in Kotlin  

## 🔤 Definitions (runBlocking & launch)

- **`runBlocking {}`**  
  Blocks the current thread until all coroutines inside it complete. Commonly used in `main()` or tests. Think of it as the **shift manager** who waits until all tasks are done before closing the kitchen.

- **`launch {}`**  
  Starts a new coroutine without blocking the current thread. Think of it as assigning a task to a **kitchen worker** who works independently.

|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `runBlocking`  | "Main manager waits till all tasks are done"        | **Kitchen ka manager har kaam mukammal hone tak rukta hai**                   |
| `launch`       | "Assign task to worker, let them work independently" | **Kaam kisi worker ko de diya, ab wo apne hisaab se karega**                 |
| `delay()`      | "Simulates time taken for a task"                   | **Kaam mein lagne wala waqt dikhane ke liye delay use hota hai**             |

## 💻 Code Examples

### 🍽️ Kitchen Shift Simulation with `runBlocking` and `launch`

```kotlin
// Import coroutine library
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() {
    println("Program Start: Opening the kitchen for the shift.")

    // runBlocking = Acts like the whole kitchen shift manager.
    // It blocks the main thread until all assigned coroutine tasks inside it are done.
    runBlocking {
        println("  [runBlocking]: Kitchen shift starts. (Thread: ${Thread.currentThread().name})")

        // Task 1: Washing dishes (takes ~1 second)
        launch {
            println("    [Launch 1]: Started washing dishes...")
            delay(1000L) // Simulate a long-running task
            println("    [Launch 1]: ...Dishes are clean.")
        }

        // Task 2: Prepping vegetables (takes ~0.5 seconds)
        launch {
            println("    [Launch 2]: Started prepping vegetables...")
            delay(500L) // Simulate a shorter task
            println("    [Launch 2]: ...Vegetables are prepped.")
        }

        // This part runs right after launching both tasks.
        println("  [runBlocking]: Main coroutine has assigned all tasks and is now waiting...")
        // runBlocking will pause here until both 'launch' coroutines finish.
    }

    // This line runs only after runBlocking (and all its coroutines) complete.
    println("Program End: All kitchen tasks are done. Shift over. Locking the door.")
}
```

## 🧑‍💼 `launch` with `job.join()` in `runBlocking`  

## 🔤 Definitions (launch)

- **`launch {}`**  
  Starts a coroutine in a fire-and-forget style. It runs independently and doesn’t block the current coroutine.

- **`job.join()`**  
  Suspends the current coroutine until the launched coroutine (`job`) finishes. Think of it as the manager waiting for the worker to complete the task.

- **`runBlocking {}`**  
  Blocks the current thread until all child coroutines inside it finish. Commonly used in `main()` functions.

|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `launch`       | "Send a worker to do a task, don’t wait"                | **Kaam kisi worker ko de diya, manager apna kaam karta raha**                |
| `job.join()`   | "Manager waits for the worker to finish"                | **Manager ruk gaya jab tak worker ka kaam mukammal nahi ho gaya**            |
| `runBlocking`  | "Main thread waits for all child tasks"                 | **Main thread tab tak rukta hai jab tak saare kaam mukammal na ho jayein**   |

## 💻 Code Examples

### 🧑‍🍳 Manager & Worker Analogy with `launch` and `job.join()`

```kotlin
// Import coroutine utilities
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking { // 'runBlocking' ensures main waits for all child coroutines to finish
    
    println("Manager (main coroutine): I need to send this report, but I have my own work to do.")
    println("Manager (main coroutine): Thread: ${Thread.currentThread().name}\n")

    // L = Launch a Worker
    // 'launch' = fire-and-forget coroutine
    // It starts a new coroutine but doesn’t block the current one.
    val job = launch { 
        println("  Worker (launch): Got the task! Starting to send the report...")
        println("  Worker (launch): Thread: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
        delay(1000L) // Simulate a long-running background task
        println("  Worker (launch): ...Report has been sent!")
    }

    // The manager continues immediately without waiting for the worker to finish
    println("Manager (main coroutine): Great, I've 'launched' that worker. Now I'll do my own paperwork.")
    delay(300L) // Simulate a shorter task for the manager
    println("Manager (main coroutine): ...Finished my paperwork.\n")

    // Even if we don’t call job.join(),
    // 'runBlocking' automatically waits for all its children before exiting.
    println("Manager (main coroutine): Now I'll just wait for that worker to be done...")
    job.join() // Explicitly wait for the launched worker to complete
    println("Manager (main coroutine): OK, the worker is done. Time to go home.")
}
```

## ⚡ `async` & `await` in Kotlin  

## 🔤 Definitions (async & await)

- **`async {}`**  
  Starts a coroutine that returns a result via a `Deferred<T>`. Multiple `async` blocks can run concurrently.

- **`await()`**  
  Suspends the current coroutine until the result of the `Deferred` is ready. It’s non-blocking and efficient.

- **Concurrency vs Parallelism**  
  `async` enables **concurrent** execution — tasks start together and run independently, saving time.

| `async`        | "Send multiple requests at once"                        | **Ek saath do kaam ke liye farmaish bhej di gayi**                            |
| `await()`      | "Wait for each answer when it’s ready"                  | **Har jawab ka intezar jab wo tayar ho jaye**                                 |
| `Deferred`     | "Promise of a future result"                            | **Wada kiya gaya hai ke result baad mein milega**                             |
| `measureTimeMillis` | "Track total time taken for tasks"                | **Pura waqt naapne ke liye stopwatch lagaya gaya hai**                        |

## 💻 Code Examples

### 👤 Building a User Profile Concurrently with `async` & `await`

```kotlin
// Import coroutine features and utility for measuring execution time
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
import kotlin.system.measureTimeMillis

// Simulates a slow network call to fetch a user's name
suspend fun fetchUsername(): String {
    println("  [Async 1]: Asking for username... (will take 1000ms)")
    delay(1000L) // Simulate network delay
    return "KotlinHero" // Return fetched username
}

// Simulates a slow network call to fetch a profile picture
suspend fun fetchProfilePictureUrl(): String {
    println("  [Async 2]: Asking for profile picture... (will take 1500ms)")
    delay(1500L) // Simulate network delay
    return "https://example.com/pic.png" // Return fetched picture URL
}

fun main() = runBlocking {
    println("Main: Need to build the user profile. I will ask for data.\n")

    val totalTime = measureTimeMillis {
        // 'async' = start concurrent tasks that return results
        // Both requests start *at the same time* (not one after another)
        val deferredUsername: Deferred<String> = async { fetchUsername() }
        val deferredPictureUrl: Deferred<String> = async { fetchProfilePictureUrl() }

        println("Main: I have 'asked' for both username and picture. Now I wait for the answers.")
        println("Main: ...waiting...\n")

        // 'await()' suspends until the result is ready (non-blocking)
        val username = deferredUsername.await()
        println("Main: Got the username! It is '$username'")

        val pictureUrl = deferredPictureUrl.await()
        println("Main: Got the picture URL! It is '$pictureUrl'\n")

        // Use both results together
        println("Main: ✅ Success! Displaying profile for '$username' with image at '$pictureUrl'")
    }

    // Measure total time — should be close to the longest single delay (≈1500ms)
    println("\nMain: Total time taken: $totalTime ms")
}
```
